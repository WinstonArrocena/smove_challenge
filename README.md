# smove_challenge
These are my solutions for the Smove challenges.

For the firmware, I cannot get a hold of either Arduino or RPi, thus I was not able to test the codes.
Although I think these may seem to work with some small debugging if there are any issues.

For the hardware, I just rely on some Arduino dimensions from the Internet for the header distances. The PCB was created using Altium.
